        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 
                Spray a baking pan with vegetable oil spray.</li>
            <li>Place frozen chicken fillets on the prepared pan 
                and bake for 10 to 12 minutes. Turn chicken, 
                sprinkle 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese on each fillet, 
                and bake until crispy, an additional 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Slice garlic bread into 4 equal portions. 
                Open each portion and place garlic side up on a baking sheet. 
                Warm garlic bread in the oven about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>To assemble the sandwiches, 
                place a chicken fillet on a piece of garlic bread, 
                spoon 1/4 cup tomato sauce or marinara sauce on top of the chicken, 
                and lay a slice of provolone on top of the sauce. Place 3 basil leaves, 
                or more to taste, on each sandwich, and top with the other half.</li>
            <li>Wrap each sandwich in foil 
                and return to the oven until the cheese is melted, 5 to 8 minutes. 
                Unwrap and serve warm.</li>
